    <h2>What makes a superhero?</h2>

    <p>
        A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person
        couldn’t. So in order to be a<br>
        superhero, <b>you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess,</b>
        and you need to use<br>
        that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero.<br>
        For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or
        human-interest story. But if it’s a<br>
        good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing
        something that a normal<br>
        human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.<br>

        Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark was a billionaire industrialist, a founding member of the Avengers, and the former
        CEO of Stark Industries. A bold and ingenious inventor, Stark boasted of being a genius, billionaire, playboy,
        and philanthropist. With vast wealth and unparalleled technical expertise, Stark stood as one of the world's
        most influential figures after the tragic loss of his parents, reveling in a playboy lifestyle until his
        abduction by the Ten Rings in Afghanistan, during a demonstration of Jericho missiles. Faced with mortal peril,
        Stark engineered an armored suit to break free from captivity. Upon his return, he deployed numerous armors to
        combat terrorists and confront Obadiah Stane, who had betrayed him. Following his showdown with Stane, Stark
        boldly revealed his alter ego as Iron Man to the public.<br>
