                        In Earth's future, a global crop blight and second Dust Bowl are slowly rendering the planet
                        uninhabitable. Professor Brand, a brilliant NASA physicist, is working on plans to save mankind
                        by transporting Earth's population to a new home via a wormhole. But first, Brand must send
                        former NASA pilot Cooper and a team of researchers through the wormhole and across the galaxy to
                        find out which of three planets could be mankind's new home.

                        Andy Dufresne, a banker, is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murders of
                        his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. Over the following two decades, he
                        befriends a fellow prisoner, Ellis "Red" Redding, and becomes instrumental in a money-laundering
                        operation led by the prison warden Samuel Norton. Andy eventually gains the respect of his
                        fellow inmates by helping them with their tax returns, and his financial advice helps the prison
                        guards and the warden himself. Andy manages to maintain hope and resilience through his unjust
                        imprisonment, ultimately leading to a surprising and inspirational conclusion.
